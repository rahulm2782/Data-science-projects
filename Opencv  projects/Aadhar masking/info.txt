Aadhar Card Reader Documentation
Introduction

This code provides a solution to read and process an image of an Aadhar card. The aim is to extract the information present in the card, and block out sensitive information to protect the privacy of the cardholder.

Libraries Used
The code uses the following libraries:

cv2: This library is used for image processing. It provides functions to read, manipulate, and save images.

re: This library provides regular expression operations, which can be used to filter data based on specific patterns.

easyocr: This library provides an easy-to-use interface for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) operations. It can be used to extract text from images.

pytesseract: This library is a wrapper for the Tesseract OCR engine. It provides functions to perform OCR on images.

matplotlib: This library is used for plotting and visualizing data. It can be used to display images and graphs.

Code Overview
The code performs the following steps:

Read the image of the Aadhar card: The image is read using the cv2.imread() function, and stored in the variable img.

Convert the image to grayscale: The image is converted to grayscale using the cv2.cvtColor() function, and stored in the variable gray_img. This step is performed to simplify the image, making it easier for OCR algorithms to extract text from it.

Visualize the Aadhar card: The image is visualized using matplotlib's plt.imshow() function. The plt.figure() function is used to set the size of the figure, and plt.axis('off') is used to turn off the axis labels.

Read the text from the grayscale image: The easyocr library is used to extract text from the grayscale image. The reader.readtext() function is used, and the extracted text is stored in the variable data1.

Filter the extracted text: The extracted text is filtered using a combination of confidence and length criteria. The text is filtered based on the following conditions:

If the confidence level is greater than 50% (indicated by i[-1] > .50).
If the length of the text is 14 characters (indicated by len(i[-2]) == 14).
Store the bounding box coordinates of the filtered text: The bounding box coordinates of the filtered text are stored in the list cord.

Draw rectangles on the original image: Two rectangles are drawn on the original image to cover the filtered text, using the cv2.rectangle() method. The size and position of the rectangles are determined using the bounding box coordinates stored in the cord list.

Visualize the final image: The final image, with the rectangles drawn on it, is visualized using matplotlib's plt.imshow() function.
